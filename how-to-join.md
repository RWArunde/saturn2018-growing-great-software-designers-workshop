# How to Join

Interested in exploring what it may take to help the next generation of
software designers?  Here is how you can become a participant in the workshop:

1. Contact one of the workshop organizers.  They’ll let you know whether
   there is still available spots in the workshop.
2. Prepare a brief "position paper" containing your ideas, questions, and
   experiences and submit it to the workshop by [forking this workshop repository
   in GitHub and issing a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
   with your position paper included.
3. Register for the SATURN 2018 conference.

You must have RSVP'd to the workshop by April 1, 2018 to participate.
Position papers are due by April 23, 2018.

## Position Papers

What should be included in your position paper?  A variety of possible ideas
could be appropriate.  [See the list of thinking questions to help get you started](questions.md).
The main point of a position paper is to create a starting off point for
planning workshop activities.  You can look at position papers from past
workshops to get an idea, or create something new.

Some ideas for what to put in a position paper:
* Explain a **personal experience** (positive and/or negative) with mentoring
  and professional growth, as either the master or the learner.
* Describe some **specific problems** that you've encountered working with fresh
  software designers (or perhaps with a grizzled veteran) that might have prevented
  you or someone else from furthering their design expertise.  Alternatively, describe
  a specific problem that worries you about future designers.
* Describe some of your own **philosophy** regarding mentoring, teaching, and growth.
* **Ask some questions** -- What are you most curious or concerned or excited or confused
  or ... about growing great software designers?  Oftentimes a good question is more
  valuable than 100 answers.

All workshop material will be published to the GitHub repository including write-ups,
images, and position papers.  Having run a few workshops now, we’ve found that using GitHub
as the publicly available resource and mechanism for organization is rather tidy and useful.
