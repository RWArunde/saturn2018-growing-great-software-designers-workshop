# What is with the apathy?

Joe Runde (joe@joerun.de), Software Engineer at IBM, Pittsburgh

Submission to the SATURN 2018 workshop: Growing great software designers. Planned for May 7, 2018 in Plano, TX, USA.

## Introduction

Two years ago, I decided to stop being a broke grad student and took a development job with IBM. In that time (and with good mentorship) I've learned quite a bit of the theory behind building good software. Confusingly, I see very little of it in practice. Are my coworkers willfully ignorant of established software design practices? _Un_-willfully ignorant? Or does nobody care anymore? 

The following adaptations of _The Onion_ articles represent a majority of my interactions during a work day. Names changed to protect the guilty, some quotes verbatim.

## Engineer With Legendary Hacker Rank Still Waiting To Be Awarded With Lamborghini

<p align="justify">
SEATTLE—Ruthlessly moving to stake his claim to a senior role in technical leadership and a Lamborghini, a local software intern spent three hours of his work day solving Hacker Rank challenges, those close to Microsoft report. “In what can only be seen as an unusually audacious seizing of power, His Highness Eric the Intern has systematically eliminated the entire reporting structure by decreeing his technical dominance from a nap pod near the lunch room,” said sources close to the Gates family, who detailed how the newly hired intern moved to eliminate a meeting from his schedule: “A presentation on using Istio to enable smarter deployments of our service mesh? That’s networking right? No thanks- I already mastered TCP.” Stunned onlookers watched dumbfounded as Eric deftly solved the infamous ring-of-gas-stations problem in less than forty-seven minutes. “As the Intern’s—pardon us, the Senior Tech Lead’s—savage display of skill intensified, His Royal Technical Eminence has decreed in his mercy that his disgraced coworkers, those architects, testers and developers who sought to deliver a consistent velocity this iteration, will be allowed their careers, though their remaining years will be spent wallowing in the squalid Cubicle Farm, subsisting only on what scraps of maintenance projects the company deems too important to cancel; and, if they see their way to grace by approving His promotion, they shall avert the torture of the Farm and He will grace their inboxes with His pull requests.” Acknowledging the need for the Business to continue making money to buy His Lamborghinis, the as-yet un-promoted CTO has decreed that his team shall finish delivering the features they had promised in Q2, after which He will take over all development, setting their poor, bug-ridden designs on a public GitHub repo as a warning to all usurpers.

## Nothing Is Better Than Pair Programming, Says Dev Who Has Apparently Never Programmed On Her Own

<p align="justify">
DENVER, CO—Naively insisting that we seek pair programming partners with the confidence to deliberate decisions and come to a better solution, Denver systems analyst Jennifer Thomas, 32, stated Monday that “nothing is better than good teamwork,” clearly demonstrating that she has never seen Eric the Intern bully his way through a pairing session and implement all of his ideas anyway. “Being able to listen to your partner and draw from their experiences is the best thing a programmer can do,” said Thomas, who has never witnessed a Mountain-Dew fueled Eric grab the keyboard from his pair partner, read the project documentation exclaiming, “A tiered architecture? What’s that? I’ll put this database client into the service handler!”, and force push to master, dismissing the negative reviews with a hearty, “Those are just your opinions, _my_ code works.” Thomas, clearly lacking in real world experience, continues, “Honestly, I believe it’s about the way you work together to create code that promotes your quality attributes. Take maintainability: If you love your future maintainers [as long as they’re not engineers waging a ham-fisted battle with legacy code by trying to read the documentation, instead of going through the code line by line like they should be competent enough to do] then you build trust with your stakeholders.” Evidently Thomas has never seen Eric close six deployment stories on a Friday afternoon, doubling the team’s velocity to the delight of the project manager. Who cares that every service crashed on Monday morning because they were all misconfigured?

## Interns Demand to Know How Project Managers Got Team To Accept Project Before Requirements Were Completed

<p align="justify">
WASHINGTON—Repeatedly hitting the project management team with questions about their unorthodox methodology, Eric the Intern demanded Wednesday that George Butterfield, 37, his project manager, tell him exactly how he got the rest of the team to accept a project with vague requirements without a fight. “Mr. Butterfield, please explain in detail how you convinced the team to voluntarily take on a project without receiving clearly drawn UML diagrams for every use case,” said Eric, echoing concerns from other interns on Slack as they sought to understand how they could possibly be expected to meet with stakeholders and iterate on the acceptance criteria for each feature. “We want to make sure we have this right: Even after the sales teams promised a feature that we don’t have, and you found out that the API teams haven’t come to a consensus on how we’re delivering it, and the front end teams admitted that they don’t have precise documentation for all the functionality they need from us, there wasn’t much backlash for accepting the project at all? Could you just outline for us precisely how you can coerce people into accepting work when the other teams have not done their jobs at all? Thank you.” At press time, Butterfield was asking Eric to please take and read his copy of The Pragmatic Programmer. “No thanks,” was the reply, “That’s just syntax. I know syntax, haven’t you seen my Hacker Rank?”
