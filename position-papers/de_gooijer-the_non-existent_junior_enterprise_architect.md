# The non-existent junior enterprise architect
Thijmen de Gooijer (thijmen@acm.org), IT Architect at Kommuninvest, Ã–rebro (Sweden)

Submission to the SATURN 2018 workshop: Growing great software designers. Planned for May 7, 2018 in Plano, TX, USA.

## Introduction
Architects model complex systems and processes to define and reason about decisions on the structures of software. Some believe this requires extensive experience in building software systems: the practicing of architecture can only be entrusted to senior software engineers promoted to become architects. The default career assumed in many ads for architecture jobs reads something like this:

	* university level computer science/engineering/mathematics degree
	* deep experience in technology of the house (e.g. C# and .Net in a Microsoft shop)
	* 5-10+ years of development experience
	* previous architecting experience
	* desirable: leadership experience

I have met many people who find it difficult to accept my career straight our of university into software architecture practice. Reality is that I was hired into an architecture job three times since came out of university in 2011. All my former and current employers are more than happy about my job performance. I published academically on architecture and actively contribute to expert conferences like SATURN. A praised and well-written Swedish book on architecture claims there is no such thing as junior enterprise architects [1]. Yet, I have done successful work in this branch of architecture.

The position I take in this paper is that of questioning the mental model of what makes a good designer or architect: who to grow into designers and architects? For example, what personalities fit architects versus developers and other technical roles? The perspective that I contribute is that of a junior enterprise architect: how did I end-up here, and how do I try to grow the next generation of software designers.

## How I grew into a designer
The caveat of my quick entry into the architecture profession is that I got a head start with a high-quality double MSc degree in software engineering. Already during my second BSc year, I was a teaching assistant in programming courses. I spent countless hours coaching my students in writing better programs, pair programming with them, and debugging their code. I worked as a TA about half-time (i.e. 20 hours/week) for three years, not only teaching programming but also (among others) software modeling, requirements engineering, and human-computer interaction, all at BSc level. I taught software modeling in collaboration with Patricia Lago an accomplished researcher in the architecture domain [2]. 

After completing my MSc degrees, I obtained a lot of process knowledge and experience: how to do architecture. I joined ABB's corporate research group in software architecture, and left with what I often call a PhD without the degree paper. For five years, I modeled, reverse-architected, and researched complex industrial software-intensive systems. My colleagues and I secured intellectual property for ABB by patent applications, secret strategy, and publication. Often that meant reading up to understand the state-of-the-art in a particular branch of software architecture, of course increasing my theoretical knowledge. I was also blessed with learning from countless accomplished colleagues in ABB's global research and IT organizations. Their mentorship helped me decide what to read, and what to do to become a better architect. When I ended my research career I had what I would call deep theoretical understanding of software development and architecture, done a fair share of modeling and prototyping, and not unimportant: writing and presenting.

The operational perspective and more traditional IT knowledge came with a move into corporate IT. I took a job in an IT group and studied ITIL. Before architects can attempt to move to design a DevOps system or life cycle, they must know how an average IT organization runs operations and especially how it deals with change to software systems. 

While growing and to continue my growth these were my main hurdles:

	- Finding a suitable mentor that was well aware of my technical work to get useful feedback.
	- Decide how to continuously learn: what not to read? What conferences and courses to go to?
	- Staying up to speed with relevant changes in technology: what areas to watch, what to let go?

## Software design skills my employers needed
My interest in the architecture profession has always been connecting business and technical people: acting as an interpreter speaking software while having a good understanding of the business goals. Gregor Hohpe calls this the architect elevator [3]. One needs top-notch technical knowledge and understanding to translate design questions and problems to understandable English for laymen. However, being successful in this translation exercise does not necessarily require years of coding experience, it is a more generic software engineering and design skill.

My current employer and former employers usually relied on a combination of three skill/knowledge sets: requirements engineering; software development processes, i.e. way of working; and software design. I will now describe these skillsets in slightly more detail.

The first skillset revolves around requirements engineering includes capabilities such as:

	- Translating business questions into technical and development process requirements.
	- Supporting negotiation with suppliers to reach sensible technical agreements.
	- Quality assessment of software artifacts developed by consultants.

The second skillset is guidance of the software engineering and design process:

	- Day-to-day software development process guidance, coaching & mentorship.
	- Lifecycle management of software artifacts, for example formulating strategies for dealing with technical debt.
	- Successfully delivering changes to production and implementation of DevOps practices.

The third skillset consists of more pure architecture and design skills including:

	- Information management and architecture often across multiple applications.
	- Designing appropriate security solutions based on data sensitivity.
	- Guiding application lifecycles, what to do with legacy applications? 
	- Selecting and evaluating technology, for example by building prototypes or performing experiments.

## Growing the next generation of designers
Since I moved out of research into IT practice, I am not only a learner but also (again) a teacher of software design. The previous sections aim to provoke thought about who to grow into designers and what skills new designers may need. Now I will summarize what I do to grow my current development team, and to stay in touch with 'the engine room' [3] myself:

	- Collaborative code reviews on a sample of deliverables from the previous sprint to look for architecture evident code, and potentially important decisions.
	- Coaching and requiring documentation of significant design decisions in architecture decision records [4].
	- Enable progress of the development team: contracts, procurement (licenses, but also technology investigation), relations with IT operations.
	- Acting as a sparring partner for technical decisions and hindrances.
	- Finally, I have a strong ambition to practice more pair programming than the very limited time I manage to do that today.
