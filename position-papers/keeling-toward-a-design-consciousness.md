SATURN 2018 Growing Great Software Architects Workshop position paper

The subtitle of my book [Design It!](https://amzn.to/2r6DdWJ) is _from programmer to software architect_.  This
subtitle is partially an homage to [The Pragmatic Programmer: from Jouneyman to Master](https://amzn.to/2HZJY7e).
but it was also meant to indicate that this book was meant as a guide for aspiring architects on their
journey toward mastery.  This journey, _from programmer to software architect_, was at the forefront of my
mind throughout the writing process.  I worked hard to fill every page of every chapter with practical and
useful advice taken from my own experiences working with teams to ship software and mentoring future
software architects.  I think achieved my goal of creating a practical handbook, though I never attempted
to propose a model describing exactly how someone might progress from programmer to software architect.
Let's attempt to remedy this oversight now.


## Pyramid of Design Skills

In _Design It!_ I focused heavily on skills all architects, really all great software engineers, need
to be successful.  The skill sets I selected were based on how I deliver software, but heavily influenced
by Alistair Cockburn's proposed [foundations of software engineering](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Foundations+for+Software+Engineering),
especially software development as a resource constrained collaborative game, and the 9 crafts of
software engineering.  Focusing on skills I think was the right thing to do in the book since everyone
needs practical advice and practical approaches for applying those skills.  But how does someone go
about acquiring those skills to become an experienced and productive software architect?  I suggest
there are some skills which are foundational and others that build upon the foundation.

The foundation of the Skills Pyramid is _Craftsmanship_.  Craftsmanship requires both competence
in a core software construction and detailed design skills and deep sense of responsibility for
applying those skills in practice.  In other words you have to care.  Skills alone are not enough.
[Code Complete by Steve McConnell](https://amzn.to/2HzTsqE) embodies the essence of this ideal,
though there are other examples out there.

The second level of the Skills Pyramid is _Leadership and Agility_.  I struggled a bit to articulate
what to call this level.  The fundamental goal of this level of the pyramid is to learn how to
lead a team and deal with change.  This might involve learning and practicing a particular
agile methodology such as Extreme Programming or Kanban.  It also means learning how to share
ideas, collaborate together to achieve a goal, and teach others about craftsmanship. This second
level is likely a significant leap and might require years to master.

The third level of the Skills Pyramid is _Systems Thinking_.  By the time a person reaches this
level of the pyramid they are able to see threads of commonality and influence across multiple
related elements.  True systems thinking goes beyond simple _cause and effect_ and _rules of thumb_
that a person at the second level of the Pyramid might expect.  Architects must be able to operate
at this level of the pyramid so they can help their team navigate the murky and always changing
waters of a software system under development.

In _Design It!_ I suggested that the more software architects there are on a team, the easier
time that team will have dealing with the ever evolving complexities of a software system. From
the viewpoint of the Skills Pyramid, what I was really proposing was that the more systems thinkers
there are on a team, the better your chances of delivering great software.

I would also like to note that the Skills Pyramid proposed here roughly corresponds to another
idea proposed by Alistair Cockburn, [Shu Ha Ri](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Shu+Ha+Ri).  To give
a very brief explanation, Shu Ha Ri describes three stages of mastery that people go through
when learning new skills that of following (Shu), detaching (Ha), and fluent (Ri).  The [Dreyfus
Model of Skills Acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition)
popularized in the software engineering community by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt in [Herding Race
Horses and Racing Sheep](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Developing-Expertise-Dave-Thomas)
and [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](https://amzn.to/2Hxnonf).


## Going Beyond Skills: Design Consciousness

The proposed Skills Pyramid shows a conceptual path someone can follow to grow from a beginner
to an expert.  We can use the Skills Pyramid or something like it to organize curriculum and
develop training programs.  The faster we can help beginners ascend the pyramid and the more
people we help, the strong the software industry as a whole will become.  The Skills Pyramid
is the high level road map, but it is also the boundary for what an expert can be.  Becoming
a truly great designer requires something more than skills mastery.

Great designers have a design consciousness.  They are not only able to expertly apply design
skills but they have full self-awareness of their actions as a designer.  Without this
self-awareness, a designer can apply skills but not develop entirely new ones; follow the
rules but never bend or break them to invent something entirely new.

We can use the [bicameral mind hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology))
as a thought experiment for exploring this idea.  The general idea behind this hypothesis
is that part of the human brain is responsible for "speaking" or providing direction, which
another part of the brain follows.  I should point out that this theory is not generally
accepted by mainstream psychology, but it does make for interesting discussion.

If we assume a bicameral mind, then skills acquisition might be interpreted as the act of
internalizing the _voice_ of expert designers.  From this perspective, the designer
repeats and follows commands they learned from other designers.  If this were true, an
expert designer without a design consciousness would deftly execute techniques, completely
unaware that they were following the advice the designers from which the technique was
learned.

On the other hand, a thought leading designer (what is beyond _expert_?), would have complete
self-awareness and know when they are listening the _voice_ of an internalized expert,
but also would have developed their own internal voice for thinking through problems and
inventing new ideas.  Once a designer has achieved consciousness they can be truly autonomous,
self-organizing, and adaptive; that person would become the paragon of agile development 


## Developing Design Consciousness

> Consciousness isn't a journey upward, but a journey inward. - Arnold (HBO's Westworld)

If you're a fan of [HBO's Westworld](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475784/) then you
may already have noticed some similarities in my position for this workshop and the
themes in season 1 of the series.  Sadly, I don't have much to offer in way of a path
toward developing a design consciousness over ideas proposed in the series.

Not to present too many spoilers, in the first season of Westworld, we followed one of
the 'hosts' (super fancy robots that somehow defy the uncanny valley) on their journey
to consciousness.  Initially hosts were programmed to behave life-like using a hierarchy
of skills similar to the design skills pyramid proposed in this paper.  While this was
enough to create an illusion of autonomy, none of the hosts could think for truly think
for themselves, invent new ideas, or act independently of their programming.

To solve this problem, Arnold, one of the inventors of the technology behind the hosts,
programmed some robots to as a _bicameral mind_ in the hopes that they might one day
become aware of the interacting halves of their programming and gain self-awareness.
The mechanism for achieving this self-awareness was inspired by a maze in which the
robot must explore their inner self to uncover the two halves of their mind, at which
point they might unlock consciences.

It may be possible to explore a similar idea for unlocking a software design consciousness.
Perhaps activities beyond the skills pyramid would involve reflective practice and some
kind of creation with awareness.  Though what a series of exercises for unlocking this
self-awareness might look like I am unsure.  Nor am I sure why some people become self-aware
while others do not.
