# Position Papers

Once you're [confirmed for the workshop](../how-to-join.md)
please fork this repo and submit a pull request with your position paper
in this folder.  The position paper can be any format you wish and take any
form -- an essay, slides, a mind map, or something else entirely.  Markdown is
preferred, but any open format will work just fine.
