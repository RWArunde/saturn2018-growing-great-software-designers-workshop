# Some Questions for Thought

In this workshop, we will investigate the how to grow great software designers.  Here are some questions to stimulate discussion:

* What practices have you seen work?  Fail?
* What worked a decade ago that is ineffective now, and vice versa?
* Which management and other organizational practices help or inhibit growing designers?
* Are there theories about the progression to great designers, or stages along the path?
* How is the new generation is the same or different?
* How has the domain has changed or stayed the same (e.g., high scale systems, web platforms)?
* How has the lack of tools affected design?
