# SATURN 2018: Growing great software designers

The current generation of software designers is coming up in a world where it’s easier than ever to get started in software development.  Getting information on how to design doesn’t require apprenticing with a master, travel to a top university or tech hub, or piecing together wisps of current research in conference papers.  The canon is reasonably accessible in books that survey the field, there is a single-purpose textbook on software aimed at novices, and there are several conferences on software design that have each been running for more than a decade (including SATURN).

But, for someone who is trying to nurture the next generation of designers, it seems as hard as ever to do so.  Some challenges include:

* The large volume of information to master
* The number of contradictory voices claiming to know the true path
* The temptations of easy wins with quick and dirty code
* The siren song of niche expertise (eg ML, distributed systems, programming languages) over general software design expertise
* The churn of technical platforms, which often lose the accumulated wisdom of the last platform while seeking simplicity
* The rise of results-oriented processes that downplay the value of careful design
* The seeming reduction in the popularity of software books, perhaps in because of easy access to blogs and tech news sites offering advice

This workshop is an opportunity to share what we have learned and are applying in our day jobs about how to grow great software developers.  Expect to hear and share stories of valiant attempts, grand strategies, energizing wins, and humbling defeats.  We will work to generalize and distill our discussions so that others can benefit from them.

The goal of this workshop is to explore how to grow great software designers.  Our hope is that we'll end the day with several concrete suggestions and practices to share with the SATURN audience, some _ah-ha!_ moments, and a collection of challenges that must be overcome in today’s software shops.  [Here are some questions and topics that we can consider during the workshop](questions.md).

The workshop will took place on Monday, May 7, 2018 in [Plano, TX during the
SATURN 2018 conference on software architecture](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2018/).

## Position Papers

To attend the workshop, participants must submit a position paper.  There is no set length, but in the past papers have been between 2-8 pages.  [Here are some questions and topics to inspire your paper](questions.md)

# About SATURN

The 14th SEI Architecture Technology User Network (SATURN) Conference — the longest-running software architecture conference in the world — brings together influential leaders and experts to discuss architecture-centric practices for developing, acquiring, and maintaining software-reliant systems. Architects from more than 20 countries meet annually at SATURN to share ideas, network, and learn about new and existing technologies.
